# Space Platform Organizer UI

This Factorio mod adds a simple UI listing all space platforms currently available to your force.

Press the **Open space platform list** keybind (unassigned by default) to toggle the window.
The window shows platform names as buttons in a scrollable list; clicking a button opens the selected platform view.
