# Space Platform Organizer UI

This Factorio mod adds a simple UI listing all space platforms currently available to your force.

Press the **Open space platform list** keybind (unassigned by default) to toggle the window.
The window shows platform names as buttons in a scrollable list; clicking a button opens the selected platform view.
For debugging, the mod now prints the accessible properties of every surface to help identify which surfaces represent space platforms.
It also lists all available remote interfaces and their function names in the in-game chat and log whenever the hotkey is pressed.
